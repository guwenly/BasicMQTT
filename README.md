# A Basic MQTT Communication app

This 2 scripts can be used for communicating through MQTT protocol, asynchronized. 

In my case, my apartment door button wasn't working properly so I connected a raspberry with this script as listener. Then I use this method to open my apartment door by publishing to the same channel.
